1.To Start a connection , Make sure your pc is the "ONLY" device paired to your phone and bluetooth is turned on in your phone.

2.Compile and run blumouse-server.c

  (Before that you have to install the following packages :
	1.libxtst & libxtst-dev 
	2.libbluetooth & libbluetooth-dev )

  Compile using the following command:
	gcc -o blumouse-server blumouse-server.c -lbluetooth -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXtst
	
  Run from terminal using ./blumouse-server.

3.Next install and open the app (blumouse) in your phone.(This step should be done only after blumouse-server is running in terminal.)

4.Now after you run the app , you'll get two messages : 
	Accepted connection from xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx
	Connection Started :) 
  If you get these two messages , that means your phone is ready to use as a mouse :)

  Else, exit from the blumouse-server process, start in again. now relaunch the app in your phone.

  If there is any problem , you can contact me at harshavardhankode@gmail.com.
											

Caution : be careful not to tilt phone (in phones which auto align to gravity) because then, the socket will be reset..

**PS: You can change the sensitivity , and the resolution of your screen in the blumouse-server.c file (they are globals) **
